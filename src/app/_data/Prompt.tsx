  DESIGN_IDEA_PROMPT:
    "Imagine you're a logo designer tasked with crafting a unique and memorable logo for a brand named {logoTitle}. The logo should be of type {logoType} and visually represent the brand's description: {logoDesc}. The tone should be {logoTone}. Consider the existing prompt: {logoPrompt} for additional context, but feel free to explore beyond its limitations. Factor in the desired simplicity level: {logoSimplicity}. Brainstorm 9 distinct logo ideas, each summarised in a concise phrase (4-5 words). These ideas should be very easily understood. So much so, that even a toddler would understand what the ideas you are suggesting. No fancy or complicated wording, keep it dead-simple. Deliver the ideas in JSON format",
  LOGO_PROMPT:
    "Generate a text prompt for logo for the brand '{logoTitle}' that includes {logoOnly}. The brand is described as {logoDesc}. The logo should be designed in the {logoDesign} style, drawing inspiration from {logoPrompt}, and should embody the concept of {logoIdea}. Use the color palette {logoColor} for the design. The logo should have a {logoSimplicity} aesthetic, and the logo's tone should be {logoTone}. Give me result in JSON format with prompt field only. The prompt should be strictly under 1000 characters",
